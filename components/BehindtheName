            The name <span className="text-yellow-300">Hydromedon</span> carries
            the imagery of deep waters, drifting light, and quiet mystery.
            Like a jellyfish moving through the ocean’s hidden places, it
            evokes beauty, fragility, and a sense of being carried by currents
            larger than ourselves.

            In Scripture, water is a symbol of renewal, cleansing, and the
            presence of God moving in unseen ways. The name reflects that
            spiritual undercurrent — the idea that grace flows beneath the
            surface of our lives, guiding us even when we cannot see the path
            clearly.

            Hydromedon also hints at the tension between vulnerability and
            resilience. A creature made of light and softness, yet able to
            survive in the vastness of the deep. This mirrors the heart of the
            project: music born from fragile places, strengthened by faith,
            illuminated by hope.

            Ultimately, the name is an invitation — to drift, to listen, to
            breathe, and to encounter God in the quiet waters of the soul.
            Hydromedon is not just a title; it is a posture of wonder, a
            symbol of spiritual depth, and a reminder that even in the deep,
            we are held.
